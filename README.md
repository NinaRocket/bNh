# Boat-Reg

Ok, so what is boat reg? This work in progress web application will allow the user to dynamically create the letters/numbers they would like printed out for their boat registration or any other vinyl graphic needs.  

Technology used:
This web application is currently developed with React for the front end. 
node
react-select
react-bootstrap


The hope:
Once the user has saved the graphic they would like, the program will export SVG code of the graphic to the site administrator.
